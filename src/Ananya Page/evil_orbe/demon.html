With our help and support farmers are able to produce more quality crops and sell them directly to us. This will save them from supply chain costs and they will get a genuine price for the crops too. We are helping customers by providing them the organic fruits and vegetables, at affordable market rates. By doing this we are also keeping our environment healthy and green.

<span>On-Farm Food Waste</span><br><p>
Often the perfectly delicious produce that farmers grow never makes it off of the farm.  There are two primary reasons why on-farm produce is wasted:
<br>
The produce they grow is “ugly” or imperfect - it does not meet strict retail aesthetic standards simply because it is not perfect looking.  Only the produce or parts of the produce that meet strict specifications are harvested and the remainder is sometimes sold as off-grade, but is largely left in the fields to rot or sent to landfills.<br>There is surplus as a result of overproduction, lack of selling opportunities or loss of demand. </p>
<br>
